Hi! Welcome to my home page! My name is Katy Colindres and I am currently a Computer Science student at the California State University of Fulllerton, hopefully graduating in 2027!

My Favorite Labs: My Milestones as a Computer Scientist

* Lab 3: 

  Lab 3, both parts 1 and 2, was a favorite because it was the first lab where my partner was just as lost as I was with the lab. Yes, it was nice to have partners who knew a bit more about what they were doing and in turn would be great guides throughout the process of the lab, but I really enjoyed being able to have to problem solve and figure out on our own what to do next. I feel like that lab truly set a foundation for me as it made me feel like I genuinely could become a programmer if I just let myself work through things and not feel bad about not getting things right the first time because I knew that I would get there eventually.

* Lab 7, Part 2:

  I really enjoyed the second part of lab 7 since it was the first time I programmed a game. Yes, we had previously had the secret number guessing game, but blackjack is a commonly found card game. It felt really cool to understand the behind-the-scenes of a game, even if it is a very simple one compared to other games, of course. It was also interesting to me to figure out how to get the points for aces right. Overall, it made me excited to see what other games I could eventually create.

* Lab 12, Part 1: 

  This final lab, lab 12, specifically part one, was the one where I got excited even just by looking at the instructions. I am a very visual person, I love visuals, and seeing that I was finally going to be able to program something that would return a colorful image made me really happy. I really liked being able to implement what I had learned about RGB, and I even played around with the values for different colors just because it felt so cool. I know that someday I might look back on this and think it was a bit silly for me to be so intrigued by simple labs and RGB, but right now I feel like Iâ€™m having so much fun creating things myself and understanding how they work.
